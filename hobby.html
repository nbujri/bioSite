          I have also been gaming my whole life. My first console I played on
          was the SNES and enjoyed playing the Mario games. My favorite console
          though, is the PlayStation 2. Currently I play on the PC that I built
          myself and have a vast library of games on

          For the past year I have taken an interest in hiking. I go whenever I
          can on the weekends with my friends. I have not been to many hiking
          locations but have been to Pilot Mountain and Salem Lake. If I have
          the opportunity, I would like to explore more trails around the US.
